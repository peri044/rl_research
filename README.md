Reinforcement Learning Algorithms and Research. This repo is all about Reinforcement Learning algorithms and some of the stuff that I learn in the Deep RL nanodegree. 

## Project 1: Navigation (p1_navigation folder)
This project is about collecting as many yellow bananas as possible. A reward of +1 is awarded for a yellow banana and -1 for a blue banana.
